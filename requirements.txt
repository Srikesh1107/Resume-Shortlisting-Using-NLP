Assume that the sum of two odd integers is not even. This means that the sum of two odd integers is odd.

An odd integer can be expressed in the form 2k+1, where k is an integer.

Let the two odd integers be: a=2m+1and b=2n+1,where m and n are integers.

The sum of 𝑎 and  𝑏 is
              a+b=(2m+1)+(2n+1)
              a+b=2m+2n+2
              a+b=2(m+n+1).

m+n+1 s an integer because 𝑚 𝑛 are integers, and the sum and addition of integers is also an integer.

Therefore,

2(m+n+1) is of the form

k=m+n+1 is an integer.
